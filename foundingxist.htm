      <h1 class="w3-center">About The Founding</h1><br>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">Croatian football history dates back to the end of the 19th century, when the English came to Rijeka to build a factory and used their free time to play the first football matches on Croatian soil - although the Croats didn't participate.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">The English industrialists have afterwards arrived to the Croatian city of Zupanja. Upon their arrival, they have started to employ local people, and then taught the young citizens of Zupanja their games, especially football. The English spent their after-work time playing with a small, round, compact leather ball. They passed the ball, kicked it around and soon they explained the rules of the game to the locals and finally left them the ball as a gift.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">Football continued to be played in Zupanja, while the first football was found in 1979 in the Vladimir Nazor Street, in a typical border-crossing guardhouse, approximately two centuries old. The ball was made from natural leather with flaps, one of which was missing. The owner inherited the ball from his ancestors, employed by the tannin factory founded by the English.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">The first book about football, including the game rules, has been printed in Zagreb in 1896. An improved book of rules, along with explanations and guidelines, has been published in 1908. Football has been played by Croats through the gymnastic organization Croatian Falcon, while the first Croatian sports club committed to football was the First Football and Sports Club Zagreb, founded in 1903.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">Before the World War I, some English teams have visited Zagreb and Croatia, where they have been defeated by the Croatian club HASK, and after the World War I, the Split team played several matches against the teams of English battleship sailors, anchored throughout the Adriatic. Professional coaches arrived to Croatia in 1914 to train and lead Croatian teams.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">At the beginning of the 20th century, when first football clubs were founded in Croatia, football leaders wanted to found a national football federation, but the political circumstances didn't allow it. After the first public football game between HASK and PNISK, played in Zagreb in front of the University Library in 1906, the Croats developed even bigger desire to establish a national football federation. Three years later, the Croatian Sports Federation was founded.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">In 1912, the oldest and most prominent football employees in Croatia, Milovan Zoricic, Zvonimir Klobucar, Ivan Pipinic, Hinko Wurth, Dragutin Albrecht, and Branko Gavella, took over the stage to develop and improve football in Croatia. They can therefore be considered as some of the first members of the newly founded Croatian Football Federation.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">Croatia national team played its first international matches back in 1907 in Prague against Slavia. HNS continued its work during the World War I and II, including the struggle for equality within the Yugoslav Football Federation. Thus, Croatia participated in a joint football history within the former Yugoslavia, and numerous Croatian teams participated in the European Cup/Champions League and other UEFA competitions, while Croatian players participated in European Championships and World Cups in Yugoslav colours. Among the top goalscorers of the 1960 UEFA EURO and 1962 FIFA World Cup was Croatia striker Drazan Jerkovic, while Josip Skoblar won a Golden Boot as a Olympique Marseille player in 1970/71.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">With the establishment of the sovereign, independent and democratic Republic of Croatia in early 1990s, Croatian football also became independent and the HNS started to work on further development of the most popular sport in the country and the world. Croatia was admitted to FIFA in 1992, although a first admission dates back in 1941, while in 1993 Croatia was admitted to UEFA.</p>
