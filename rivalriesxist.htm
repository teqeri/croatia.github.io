      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">Croatia v. Italy: Croatia competes with Italy in games known as the Derby Adriatico or Adratic Derby, named after the Adriatic which separates the two nations. This rivalry is not to be confused with the similarly named Adriatic derby between Croatian clubs Hajduk Split and Rijeka. Croatia has not lost against Italy since 1991, with many matches between the two teams being notable for their competitive nature. During the Euro 2016 qualifying phase, Croatia and Italy played each other twice, drawing both times. Both matches were marred by crowd troubles due to flares being thrown onto the pitch, which also occurred when the two teams met at the 2012 European Championships. At the 2002 FIFA World Cup, Croatia came from behind to beat Italy 2-1, though this match was also marked by controversy after two Italian goals were disallowed. As of July 2018, the two countries have played nine times: Croatia has won three times, drawn five times, and lost once.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">Croatia v. Serbia: Stemming from the Croatian war of Independence, Croatia and Serbia have developed a politically-charged football rivalry, described as one of the fiercest rivalries in the world. Supporters of both national teams clashed for the first time at the Dinamo Zagreb-Red Star Belgrade riot, as both clubs were seen as symbols of national identity at the time. Since the breakup of Yugoslavia, both countries have continued to use their national teams to assert their national identities. Croatia and Serbia played each other for the first time during qualifying for Euro 2000, with both matches ending in a draw and sparking violence among supporters and players. Since then, the two teams have met twice in World Cup Qualifying, with Croatia winning 2-0 in Zagreb and the away leg ending in a draw after Josip Simunic and Nemanja Matic were sent off. These matches were played without away supporters and with added security to avoid crowd trouble.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">Croatia v. France: France and Croatia began competing against each other in a series of friendly exhibition games, however since 1998, their encounters have become increasingly competitive. As both countries have the red-white-blue tricolor, matches between the two are nicknamed Le derby tricolore ("Tricolor Derby") or Trobojnica ("Tricolor" game). During the 1998 World Cup, both France and Croatia reached their then-pinnacle of international prowess after the former won the tournament after defeating the latter who took third place. Twenty years later, the two teams battled the 2018 World Cup final where France overcame Croatia 4-2 to secure the trophy. Similarly to 1998, the match with France elevated Croatia to its highest-ever ranking with runners-up positioning. The two teams have competed against each other five times with France winning three matches and drawing two.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">Croatia v. Germany: Although there have only been three competitive meetings between Croatia and Germany, each of them took place at a major tournament and featured a red card. The first was a quarter-final at the 1996 European Championships, which Germany won en route to becoming champions. Two years later, Croatia eliminated Germany in a 3-0 World Cup quarter-final win, one of their most notable results to date. The two sides played each other again at the 2008 European Championships, with Croatia winning 2-1.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">Croatia v. Turkey: Croatia's first match at a major tournament was against Turkey at the 1996 European Championships, which they won after a late goal. At the 2008 European Championships, the two teams were involved in one of the most dramatic matches in the history of the tournament; Croatia took the lead with less than a minute left to play, only for Turkey to equalise almost immediately and then win the ensuing penalty shootout. Croatia responded by beating Turkey 3-0 in the 2012 European Championship playoffs, qualifying at their expense. Since then, the two teams have played each other twice, with each of them winning 1-0.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">Croatia v. England: Croatia and England have played each other eight times, six in competitive matches, some of which are regarded as the most notable matches in both teams' histories. During Euro 2008 qualifying, in addition to a 2-0 victory over England in Zagreb, Croatia were the first team to defeat England at the newly-built Wembley Stadium. The 3-2 loss to Croatia meant England failed to qualify for their first major competition since hosting Euro 96 twelve years earlier, which was also Croatia's debut tournament. England in turn went on to defeat Croatia twice during qualifying for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, which caused Croatia to miss their first World Cup since gaining independence. This included a 5-1 defeat at Wembley Stadium, which was Croatia's heaviest defeat in the modern era. The two teams also competed for a place in the quarter-finals at the 2004 European Championships, with England winning 4-2.  Most recently, they played again at the 2018 FIFA World Cup semi-finals, with Croatia winning 2-1 and ending England's best run at the tournament in 28 years. It also marked Croatia's first World Cup final, their best ever achievement at the competition.</p>
